## 📁 Project Components

### Task 1: Bike Sales Pivot Table Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze bike sales data across multiple countries, age groups, and genders

**Key Findings**:
- Identified market segmentation across 6 countries (US, UK, Australia, Germany, France, Canada)
- Discovered Germany exclusively targets the 35-64 age demographic
- UK and Australia show complete market coverage across all segments
- **Most Profitable Markets**:
  - **USA**: Female adults (35-64 years)
  - **Australia**: Female young adults (25-34 years)
  - **France**: Male young adults (25-34 years)
  - **Canada**: Female young adults (25-34 years)
- France leads in European male market penetration (<35 years)

### Task 2: Product Sales Analysis with SWITCH Function
**Objective**: Analyze product performance across English counties with automated categorization

**Technical Implementation**:
```excel
=SWITCH(TRUE, C2 > 600, "High", C2 >= 300, "Medium", "Low")
```

**Dataset Coverage**:
- 6 counties analyzed (Yorkshire, Cornwall, Lancashire, Essex, Durham, Greater Manchester)
- 3 product categories (Laptops, Smartphones, Printers)
- Sales volume categorization using conditional logic

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive pivot table summarizing sales by county and product
- Automated sales volume classification system

### Task 3: Bike Sales Data Visualization
**Objective**: Create visual representations of bike sales data for stakeholder communication

**Visualizations Created**:
- Multiple chart types demonstrating sales trends
- Geographic and demographic breakdowns
- Performance comparison visualizations
